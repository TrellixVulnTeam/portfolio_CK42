I was asigned a project to create a ToDo list and practice using inputs and forms to create a todo app.

I took this opportunity to create a madlib website where I made multiple inputs with placeholders to describe the value needed.

Pressing the submit button will make the madlib appear with all of the users input values, and the enjoyment of reading something hilarious was the best part.

The delete buttons next to each input are fully functional and delete the correct input value from the madlib.
