This is one of my most time consuming projects, but also my most motivated project.

I had an assignment to create a readline-sync game, which is what this game has originated from, but I decided to turn this game into
a single web page application to get more of an enjoyable experience from it.

I designed all of the artwork myself, worked on all of the coding, and started utilizing multiple files in order to keep a cleaner looking code.

This is definitely not going to be the finished product, but good practice to keep using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
