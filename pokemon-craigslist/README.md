I really enjoyed learning how to use API's and this small application to sell pokemon was a fun project.

I used the pokemon API, to recieve the names of the pokemon for the option in the form to add the pokemon to sell.

Click on the item you added to show you sold it, click again to undo the action. You can delete items before or after they are sold,
and you can delete all sold pokemon from the list as a whole as well.
